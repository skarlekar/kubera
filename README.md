## Definition of Kubera
Kubera (Sanskrit: कुबेर) also known as Kuvera, Kuber or Kuberan, is the Lord of Wealth and the god-king of the semi-divine Yakshas in Hindu mythology.[1] He is regarded as the regent of the North (Dik-pala), and a protector of the world (Lokapala). His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species and the owner of the treasures of the world.

## Kubernetes
Kubernetes (commonly stylized as k8s[3]) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.[4] It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts".[3] It works with a range of container tools, including Docker.[5] Many cloud services offer a Kubernetes-based platform or infrastructure as a service (PaaS or IaaS) on which Kubernetes can be deployed as a platform-providing service. Many vendors also provide their own branded Kubernetes distributions.
